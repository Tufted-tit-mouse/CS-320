How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

The way that I ensure that my code is functional and secure is by ensuring that it meets the requirements and through testing. The type of testing that I personally use is unit testing, integration testing, and static testing. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I interpret the needs through conducting interviews with the clients to ensure that I properly understand their needs. With this information I create user stories to better capture the requirements from their perspectives. 

How do I approach designing software?

I personally start with the requirements, then I mover to the actual design of the software, then I create a prototype or rough draft, followed by review and iteration, then if all works well documentation, all leading to a completed project.
